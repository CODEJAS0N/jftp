	<h1>Executing Commands</h1>
	<p>
		Using JFTP, you can manually execute FTP commands to perform some
		advanced tasks. These commands include the standard FTP commands that
		were defined in FTP protocol specification (For e.g. RFC 959) and also
		your FTP site specific commands. To execute commands, select
		<code>Remote File -> Execute Command</code>
		menu item from the menu bar. Select a command from the available list
		to execute that command. To execute a command that is not listed in
		the menu, select the sub-menu item
		<code>Other...</code>
		. This will open the
		<code>Execute Command(s)</code>
		dialog.
	</p>

		<br> In this text box, enter one or more FTP commands that you
		would like to execute. Make sure to enter only one command per line.

		<br> Clicking this button will execute the commands you have
		entered. The responses to the commands will be displayed in the <a
