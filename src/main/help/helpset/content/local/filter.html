	<h1>Setting up Filters</h1>
	<p>Another useful feature of JFTP is the ability to filter local
		files when performing various tasks. You can filter local files based
		on their name pattern, by their modification date and/or by their
		attributes. The filter will be honored by all local file tasks such as
		browsing, uploading, deleting, zipping and viewing properties.</p>
	<p>Below are a few scenarios where filters can be very handy:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Assume that, you have modified quite a few pages on your web
			site and you know that you have modified only HTML files. In this
			case, you can set up a name filter that allows only HTML files and
			upload your entire web site with out having to pick the modified
			files in various folders. When you do the upload, JFTP recurs through
			your web site and uploads only HTML files ignoring other files such
			as images, movies etc. thus, saving you time and bandwidth.</li>
		<li>Another example is if you want to upload all files that were
			modified today. In this case you can set up a date filter that allows
			only those files whose modification date is today's date.</li>
		<li>Or even better, you can set up a filter that combines both
			name and date filters.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To set up a filter on the local files, do any one of the
		following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Select <code>Local File -&gt; Apply Filter...</code> menu
			item from the menu bar
		</li>
		<li>Right click (Ctrl + click on Mac OS X) any where in the <a
			href="../userInterface/localPane.html">local pane</a> and select <code>Apply
				Filter...</code> from the context menu
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		When you do any of the above actions, a new dialog titled
		<code>Filter Local Files</code>
		will be displayed.
	</p>
	<h2 align="left">Filter by Name</h2>
	<p>
		<code>Regular Expression</code>
		<br> The name filter allows you to specify a filter based on the
		file names or name patterns. You can specify any valid <strong><em>regular
				expression</em></strong> as your filter criteria.
	</p>
	<p align="left">Below are a few commonly used regular expressions:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>.*\.html</code> matches all files with extension <em><strong>html</strong></em>.
		</li>
		<li><code>n.*</code> matches all files that start with letter '<em><strong>n</strong></em>'.
		</li>
		<li><code>.*\.html|.*\.jsp</code> matches all files with
			extensions <em><strong>html</strong></em> and <em><strong>jsp</strong></em>.
		</li>
		<li><code>index.html</code> matches all files whose name is <em><strong>index.html</strong></em>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<code>Case Sensitive</code>
		<br> Checking this check box does a case sensitive pattern
		matching. This means that the regular expression
		<code>.*\.html</code>
		will match <em><strong>index.html</strong></em> but not <em><strong>INDEX.HTML</strong></em>.
	</p>
	<h2>Filter by Date</h2>
	<p>The date filter allows you to see only those files whose
		modification date is in a given date range.</p>
	<p>
		<code>Start</code>
		<br> Start date for this filter.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>End</code>
		<br> End date for this filter.
	</p>
	<p class="tip">
		<img src="../images/tip32.gif" width="32" height="32">If you
		want to set up a filter that allows only files modified after a
		specific date, just specify the
		<code>Start</code>
		date and leave the
		<code>End</code>
		date blank. Similarly, to allow files that were modified before a
		specific date, leave the
		<code>Start</code>
		date blank and specify the
		<code>End</code>
		date.
	</p>
	<h2>Filter by Attributes</h2>
	<p>
		<code>Show Hidden Files and Folders</code>
		<br> Check this box to allow hidden files and folders pass
		through this filter.
	</p>
	<p class="note">
		<img src="../images/note32.gif" width="32" height="32">All newly
		opened sessions will have a default filter that hides hidden files and
		folders. If you want to see all hidden files and folders, select
		<code>Local System -&gt; Clear Filter</code>
		menu item from the menu bar.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Apply</code>
		<br> Clicking this button will validate your filter criteria and
		sets up a filter. At this point, all FTP and local file tasks that you
		perform will honor the filter.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Cancel</code>
		<br> Clicking this button discards any changes you have made to
		the filter criteria and closes the Filter Local Files dialog.
	</p>
