		directories that you would like to delete and do any one of the
		following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Press the <code>Delete</code> key on your keyboard (This will
			work if and only if the directory list table has focus)
		</li>
		<li>Select the menu item <code>Local File -&gt; Delete</code>
			from the menu bar
		</li>

	<p>When you do any of the above actions, a confirmation dialog will

		If you answer
		<code>Yes</code>
		the selected objects will be deleted permanently from the local
		system. Clicking
		<code>No</code>
		would cancel the delete action.
