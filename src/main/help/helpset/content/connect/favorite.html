	<h1>Connecting to your Favorite FTP Site</h1>
	<p>With JFTP, connecting to your favorite FTP site is just a mouse
		click away. Open the favorite manager by doing any of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Select the menu item <code>Tools -&gt; Manage
				Favorites...</code> from the menu bar
		</li>
		<li>Click on the <img src="../images/favorites16.gif" border="0"
			width="16" height="16" alt="Manage Favorites">&nbsp; icon in
			the tool bar.
	</ul>
	<p>
		When you do any of the above actions, a new dialog titled, Manage
		Favorites will be displayed. This dialog displays all your favorite
		FTP sites, sorted in alphabetical order. Locate the FTP site that you
		would like to connect to, and double click on it. This will close the
		<code>Manage Favorites</code>
		dialog box and connects to the selected site. Alternatively, you can
		highlight the FTP site that you would like to connect to, and press
		the
		<code>Connect</code>
		button to connect to the selected site.
	</p>

		<img src="../images/tip32.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"
			align="bottom"> To quickly locate a site in the list, on your
		key board, press the key that matches the first letter of the FTP
		site's label. For example, press the key
		<code>N</code>
		to select the FTP site starting with the letter
		<code>N</code>
		.
