<title>Introduction to SSL (Secured Sockets Layer)</title>

	<h1>Introduction to SSL (Secured Sockets Layer)</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the most widely used protocol for
		implementing cryptography on the Web. SSL uses a combination of
		cryptographic processes to provide secure communication over a
		network. This section provides an introduction to SSL and the
		cryptographic processes it uses.</p>
	<p>SSL was developed by Netscape in 1994, and with input from the
		Internet community, has evolved to become a standard. It is now under
		the control of the international standards organization, the Internet
		Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF has renamed SSL to Transport
		Layer Security (TLS), and released the first specification, version
		1.0, in January 1999. TLS 1.0 is a modest upgrade to the most recent
		version of SSL, version 3.0. The differences between SSL 3.0 and TLS
		1.0 are minor.</p>
	<h2>Why Use SSL</h2>
	<p>Transferring sensitive information over a network can be risky
		due to the following three issues:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You cannot always be sure that the entity with whom you are
			communicating is really who you think it is.</li>
		<li>Network data can be intercepted, so it is possible that it
			can be read by an unauthorized third party, sometimes known as an
			attacker.</li>
		<li>If an attacker can intercept the data, the attacker may be
			able to modify the data before sending it on to the receiver.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>SSL addresses each of these issues. It addresses the first issue
		by optionally allowing each of two communicating parties to ensure the
		identity of the other party in a process called authentication. Once
		the parties are authenticated, SSL provides an encrypted connection
		between the two parties for secure message transmission. Encrypting
		the communication between the two parties provides privacy and
		therefore addresses the second issue. The encryption algorithms used
		with SSL include a secure hash function, which is similar to a
		checksum. This ensures that data is not modified in transit. The
		secure hash function addresses the third issue of data integrity.</p>
	<p>The most obvious example of when you would use SSL is in an
		e-commerce transaction. In an e-commerce transaction, it would be
		foolish to assume that you can guarantee the identity of the server
		with whom you are communicating. It would be easy enough for someone
		to create a phony Web site promising great services if only you enter
		your credit card number. SSL allows you, the client, to authenticate
		the identity of the server. It also allows the server to authenticate
		the identity of the client, although in Internet transactions, this is
		seldom done.</p>
	<p>Once the client and the server are comfortable with each other's
		identity, SSL provides privacy and data integrity through the
		encryption algorithms it uses. This allows sensitive information, such
		as credit card numbers, to be transmitted securely over the Internet.
