	<h1>Installing a Certificate</h1>
	<p>
		When connecting to an FTP site using SSL, if the certificate sent by
		the server is not in your list of trusted certificates, a
		<code>Security Warning</code>
		dialog is displayed.
	</p>
	<p>
		The
		<code>Security Warning</code>
		dialog gives you the following information about the certificate.
	<ul>
		<li>If the date on digital certificate sent by the server is
			still valid</li>
		<li>If the name on the digital certificate matches the host name
			that you are connected to</li>
		<li>If the certificate was signed by any one of the certificate
			authorities that you trust</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To trust the certificate for this session and continue working with
		the FTP site, click on the
		<code>Yes</code>
		button.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you do not trust the certificate, click on the
		<code>No</code>
		button. This will immediately terminate the connection with the FTP
		site.
	</p>
	<p>
		To view and/or install the certificate, click on the
		<code>View Certificate</code>
		button. This will open a new dialog titled
		<code>Certificate Information</code>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		Click on the
		<code>Install</code>
		button to add this certificate to your list of trusted certificates.
		Once a certificate is installed, subsequent connections to that FTP
		site will be accepted silently as long as the server sends the same
		certificate.
