	<h1>What is JFTP?</h1>
	<p>JFTP is a graphical FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client software
		for transferring files from one computer to another. JFTP can connect
		to any system that has a valid Internet address and an FTP server
		program, allowing you to transfer files between a wide variety of
		systems such as Windows, UNIX and iSeries (formerly known as AS/400)
		systems.</p>
	<p>
		JFTP integrates the most widely used and widely accepted security
		mechanism, <a href="../security/introduction.html">SSL (Secure
			Socket Layer)</a> to securely transfer business critical and sensitive
		data.
	</p>
	<p>
		JFTP is written entirely in Java<sup>TM</sup>, meaning, it can run on
		a wide variety of platforms such as Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, Linux,
		HP-UX, OS/2, UNIX or any other platform with a compatible JVM (Java
		Virtual Machine).
