	<h1>Features</h1>
	<h2>&quot;The Universal FTP Client&quot;</h2>
	<p>
		A <strong>&quot;true&quot;</strong> Universal FTP Client. JFTP can be
		installed and run on a wide variety of platforms such as:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003</li>
		<li>Mac OS X</li>
		<li>Linux</li>
		<li>Solaris</li>
		<li>HP-UX</li>
		<li>OS/2</li>
		<li>UNIX</li>
		<li>Any other platform with a Java Runtime Environment</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>JFTP integrates the most widely used and widely accepted
		security mechanism, SSL (Secured Sockets Layer), to securely transfer
		your business critical and sensitive data.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Support for SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0</li>
		<li>Supports several cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, RC4,
			DES, Triple DES, Diffie-Hellman and DSA</li>
		<li>Support for both Explicit and Implicit SSL connections</li>
		<li>Option of using SSL if it is supported by the FTP server</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>File Filters</h2>
	<p>
		File filters give you the ability to decide what all files may be
		viewed, uploaded, downloaded or deleted within JFTP. You can set up <strong>inclusion</strong>
		or <strong>exclusion</strong> filters on local and/or remote files
		based on a variety of criteria such as:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>File name pattern using <strong>regular expressions</strong>
		</li>
		<li>Modification date of the files</li>
		<li>Attributes of the files (if a file is hidden or not)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>With the help of file filters, uploading all the files in your
		site that were modified on a specific date is as easy as a click of a
		mouse. No more need to spend time in picking up individual files in
		several directories of your web site.</p>
	<h2>Certificate Manager</h2>
	<p>JFTP comes with a built-in certificate manager to manage all
		your trusted certificates. Certificates are used to establish secured
		FTP connections. Using the certificate manger, you can -</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Import certificates into your trusted certificates database</li>
		<li>View details of a certificate</li>
		<li>Delete certificates from your trusted certificates database</li>
	</ul>

		quickly and easily. You can configure both simple and advanced
		connection parameters, all in one connection dialog.</p>

		parameters such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Whether to use plain FTP connection or secured FTP connection
		</li>

			servers just use user name and password for login, but, some require
			an account name to be specified for login</li>
		<li>Option of encrypting just the command channel to securely
			transmit the password over the network</li>
		<li>Specify initial local and remote working directories to set
			soon after login</li>
		<li>Option to use passive or active data transfers</li>
		<li>Option to execute raw FTP commands (standard or custom) soon
			after log in</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Simultaneous FTP Sessions</h2>
	<p>JFTP allows you to work with multiple FTP sites simultaneously.
		Each session will create a new tab making it easy to switch between
		sessions.</p>

			processed recursively</li>

			a different name</li>

			downloading</li>

		<li>Open, Edit, Print or E-mail remote files using the associated

		very useful when you are transferring hundreds or thousands of files
		of different types, in which case manually setting the transfer type
		is impossible.</p>

	<p>Support for Internationalization and Localization. This means
		JFTP supports multiple languages and Locale specific data such as
		dates and numbers. You can install as many language packs as you wish
