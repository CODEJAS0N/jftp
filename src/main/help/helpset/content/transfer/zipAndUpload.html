	<h1>Zip and Upload</h1>
	<p>
		Using the
		<code>Zip and Upload</code>
		feature, you can compress one or more files and/or directories in to a
		single zip file and then upload the zip file to your FTP site, all in
		one easy step. To do this -
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If you are not already connected to the target FTP site, <a
			href="../connect/index.html">connect</a> now
		</li>
		<li>In the <a href="../userInterface/remotePane.html">remote
				pane</a>, change the working directory to the one that you would like to
			transfer the zip file to
		</li>
		<li>In the <a href="../userInterface/localPane.html">local
				pane</a>, select (highlight) the files and/or directories that you would
			like to zip and upload and, do any one of the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Select the menu item <code>FTP -&gt; Zip and
						Upload... </code>from the menu bar
				</li>
				<li>In the <a href="../userInterface/localPane.html">local
						pane</a>, right click on any of the selected objects and choose <code>Zip
						and Upload... </code>from the context menu
				</li>
				<li>Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + F9</code> (<code>Command
						+ Shift + F9</code> on Mac OS X) key on your key board
				</li>
			</ul> When you do any one of the above actions, a new dialog titled <code>Zip
				and Upload </code> will be displayed.
		</li>
	</ol>

		<code>Zip File Name</code>
		<br> Specify a name for the target zip file
	</p>
	<p align="left">
		<code>Create zip file in a temporary directory and delete it
			after uploading</code>
		<br> Select this option if you do not want to keep the zip file
		on your local system. JFTP creates the zip file in a temporary
		directory, uploads it and then deletes the zip file from the temporary
		location.
