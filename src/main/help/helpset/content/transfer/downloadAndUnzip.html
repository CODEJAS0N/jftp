	<h1>Download and Unzip</h1>
	<p>Yet another feature of JFTP is the ability to unzip compressed
		files soon after downloading. Follow the steps given below in order to
		do this:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If you are not already connected to the source FTP site, <a
			href="../connect/index.html">connect</a> now
		</li>
		<li>In the <a href="../userInterface/localPane.html">local
				pane</a>, change the working directory to the one that you would like to
			unzip the contents of the zip file
		</li>
		<li>In the <a href="../userInterface/remotePane.html">remote
				pane</a>, select (highlight) a single zip file that you would like to
			download and unzip and, do one of the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Select the menu item <code>FTP -&gt; Download and
						Unzip... </code>from the menu bar
				</li>
				<li>In the remote pane, right click on the selected zip file
					and choose <code>Download and Unzip... </code> from the context
					menu
				</li>
				<li>Press <code>Ctrl + Shift + F7</code> (<code>Command
						+ Shift + F7</code> on Mac OS X) key on your key board
				</li>
			</ul> When you do any one of the above actions, a new dialog titled <code>Download
				and Unzip </code>will be displayed.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Unzip Options</h2>

		<code>Download the files to a temporary directory and delete it
			after unzipping</code>
		<br> Use this option if you do not want to keep the zip file that

		location.

		want to download the zip file.

		can locate and select the directory where you want to download the zip
		file.

		options, click on this button to start the download and unzip process.
