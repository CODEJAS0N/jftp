	<h1>Transfer Modes</h1>
	<p>
		Using JFTP, you can transfer files in
		<code>ASCII</code>
		,
		<code>Binary/Image</code>
		or
		<code>Auto-Detect</code>
		mode. Failing to transfer a file in correct mode may corrupt the file
		and it may become useless on the target system.
	</p>
	<h2>ASCII Mode</h2>
	<p>
		All files that contain plain text must be transferred in
		<code>ASCII</code>
		mode. Examples of such files would be TXT, HTML, JSP, or XML files.
	</p>
	<h2>Binary/Image) Mode</h2>
	<p>
		All files that contain binary data must be transferred in
		<code>Binary/Image</code>
		mode. This would include EXE, BMP, GIF, JPG or ZIP files.
	</p>
	<h2>Auto-Detect Mode</h2>
	<p>
		The
		<code>Auto-Detect</code>
		(automatic detection) mode becomes handy when you have to transfer
		multiple files and directories (a few hundreds or even thousands). In
		this case, separating the files that are to be transferred in ASCII
		mode and Binary mode becomes a real pain. To overcome this problem,
		JFTP provides a place where you can specify what transfer mode to use
		for what files. (<a href="../preferences/transferModes.html">Click
			here to learn how to configure transfer modes based on the file's
			extension</a>). When you set the transfer mode to
		<code>Auto-Detect</code>
		, JFTP automatically determines the transfer mode for a given file and
		transfers the file in correct mode, thus saving time and reducing the
		chances of corrupting the files.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you start JFTP, the transfer type is always set to
		<code>Auto-Detect</code>
		. To change the transfer mode to ASCII, select
		<code>Transfer Mode -&gt; ASCII</code>
		menu item from the menu bar. To change the transfer mode to
		<code>Binary/Image</code>
		, select
		<code>Transfer Mode -&gt; Binary/Image</code>
		menu item from the menu bar.
