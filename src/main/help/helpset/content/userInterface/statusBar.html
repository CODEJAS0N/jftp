	<h1>Status Bar</h1>
	<p>Status bar is used to let the user know what JFTP is doing
		currently. For e.g. If JFTP is currently downloading or uploading a
		file etc. Please note that every session will have its own status bar.
	</p>
	<p>The status bar is divided in to five different parts to display
		the following information:
	<ol>
		<li>Status message</li>
		<li>Percentage of bytes transferred or processed</li>
		<li>Elapsed time since a process has begun</li>
		<li>Average number of bytes transferred or processed per second</li>
		<li>The type of session &#8211; secured or unsecured. A lock
			symbol in the right corner indicates that the connection is secured.
		</li>
	</ol>
