	<h1>Session Tabs</h1>
	<p>One of the many features of JFTP is the ability to work with
		multiple FTP sites simultaneously. You can open as many sessions as
		you want and connect each session to a different FTP site and transfer
		files between your PC and the connected FTP sites simultaneously.</p>
	<p>
		Every session is opened in a new tab and, will have its own title, <a
			href="logPane.html">log pane</a>, <a href="localPane.html">local
			pane</a>, <a href="remotePane.html">remote pane</a> and <a
			href="statusBar.html">status bar</a>, thus, allowing you to work with
		multiple FTP sites simultaneously.
	</p>
	<p>
		Based on the current active session and the state of the session, the
		buttons in the <a href="toolBar.html">tool bar</a> and <a
			href="menuBar.html">menu bar</a> will be enabled or disabled. To
		switch between sessions, click on the session's title (or tab).
