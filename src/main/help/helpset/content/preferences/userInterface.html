		<code>Look and Feel</code>
		displays all installed look and feels in your JRE (Java Runtime
		Environment). The Look and Feel displays all installed look and feels
		in your JRE (Java Runtime Environment). The items in this drop-down
		box vary depending on your operating system and JRE implementation.

		<img src="../images/note32.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"
			align="bottom" alt="Note"> The default installation of JFTP
		sets the look and feel to the platform's native look and feel; i.e. On
		Windows, the look and feel is set to Windows native look and feel. On
		Mac OS X, it will be set to Aqua look and feel. On all other operating
		systems, the default is set to Java look and feel.
