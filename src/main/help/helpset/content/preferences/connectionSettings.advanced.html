	<h1>Advanced</h1>
	<p>
		To view or change the advanced connection settings, open the
		<code>Preferences</code>
		dialog by selecting
		<code>
			Tools -&gt; Preferences (
			<code>JFTP -&gt; Preferences</code>
			on Mac OS X)
		</code>
		menu item from the menu bar. Click on the
		<code>Connection Settings -&gt; Advanced</code>
		category in the left frame. This will display the existing advanced
		connection settings.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Default FTP Client</code>
		<br> Select the FTP client that you would like to use as the
		default FTP client. This drop-down box contains a list of all
		installed FTP clients. You can see the list by clicking on the down
		arrow of the drop-down box. The default installation of JFTP comes
		with two different clients:
	<ul>
		<li><code>Default FTP Client</code></li>
		<li><code>AS/400 FTP Client</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The
		<code>Default FTP Client</code>
		works well with most FTP servers. The
		<code>AS/400 FTP Client</code>
		is specifically designed for working with AS/400 FTP servers.
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Default List Parser</code>
		<br> Select a list parser that you would like to use as the
		default list parser. This drop-down box contains a list of all
		installed list parsers. A list parser is a small program used to parse
		the directory listing produced by an FTP server in response to the
		LIST command. The default installation of JFTP comes with the
		following two list parsers:
	<ul>
		<li><code>Default List Parser (UNIX)</code></li>
		<li><code>MS-DOS List Parser</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The
		<code>Default List Parser</code>
		works well with most FTP servers that produce UNIX style directory
		listing. The
		<code>MS-DOS List Parser</code>
		is used to parse the DOS/Windows style directory listing.
	</p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Transfer Data in Passive Mode</code>
		<br> To transfer a file using FTP, a data connection needs to be
		established between your PC and the FTP site. The data connection can
		be opened in either active or passive modes. In the active mode, the
		FTP site establishes the data connection to your PC (client). In the
		passive mode, the PC establishes a connection to the FTP site. The
		passive mode is helpful if you are behind a firewall and your firewall
		does not accept incoming connections from computers outside of your
		network. Check this box if you want to use
		<code>Passive</code>
		mode as the default data transfer mode. Uncheck this to use
		<code>Active</code>
		mode as the default data transfer mode.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Default Buffer Size</code>
		<br> Buffering is used to improve the performance when reading
		data from or writing data to files. Specify the buffer size to use
		while uploading or downloading files. The default installation sets
		this value to 64 Kilo Bytes.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Default Timeout</code>
		<br> Specify the timeout in minutes. Timeout may be defined as
		the maximum time that JFTP waits for a server response. If no data is
		received in the specified amount of time, JFTP will disconnect from
		the FTP server. The default value of timeout is set to 5 minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you are done, click on the
		<code>Save</code>
		button to save all your changes. This would also close the
		<code>Preferences</code>
		dialog.
