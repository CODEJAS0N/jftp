	<h1>Working with Multiple Sessions</h1>


	<p>One of the many features of JFTP is the ability to work with
		multiple FTP sites simultaneously. You can open as many sessions as
		you want and connect each session to a different FTP site and transfer
		files between your PC and the connected FTP sites simultaneously.</p>
	<p>This section explains in detail on how to work with multiple FTP
		sessions. To learn more, click on any of the sub-topics below.
