	<h1>Adding a Favorite</h1>
	<p>To add an FTP site to your list of favorites, open the favorite
		manager by doing any one of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Select <code>Tools -&gt; Manage Favorites...</code> menu item
			from the menu bar
		</li>
		<li>Click on the <img src="../images/favorites16.gif" width="16"
			height="16">&nbsp;&nbsp;icon in the tool bar
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This will open the
		<code>Manage favorites</code>
		dialog. Click on the
		<code>Add</code>
		button in the
		<code>Manage Favorites</code>
		dialog. This will open another dialog titled
		<code>Add Favorite FTP Site</code>
		which allows you to specify your FTP site's details.
	</p>
	<p>
		The
		<code>Add Favorite FTP Site</code>
		dialog has four tabs namely,
		<code>General</code>
		,
		<code>Security</code>
		,
		<code>Advanced</code>
		and
		<code>Commands</code>
		. By default, when ever you open the dialog, the
		<code>General</code>
		tab gets activated. To activate another tab, just click on the desired
		tab.
	</p>
	<p class="note">
		<img src="../images/note32.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"
			align="bottom" alt="Note"> In most cases, you just have to fill
		in the
		<code>Host Name</code>
		,
		<code>User Name</code>
		and
		<code>Password</code>
		in the
		<code>General</code>
		tab. All other fields will be filled in with default values (some are
		taken from your global preferences), which will work with most FTP
		sites.
	</p>
	<h2>General Tab</h2>
	<p>
		<code>Label</code>
		<br> Enter a label (or a descriptive name) for this site. For
		e.g.
		<code>Netscape</code>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Host Name</code>
		<br> Enter the host name or IP address of the FTP site that you
		wish to connect to. For e.g.
		<code>ftp.netscape.com</code>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>User Name</code>
		<br> To log on to an FTP site, you must identify yourself with a
		valid user name and password and optionally an account number or
		account name. In this field, enter the user name that you would like
		to use for log in. If you are connecting to an anonymous FTP site such
		as
		<code>ftp.netscape.com</code>
		, enter the word
		<code>anonymous</code>
		as user name.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Password</code>
		<br> Enter your password for logging in to the FTP site. If you
		are connecting to an anonymous FTP site such as
		<code>ftp.netscape.com</code>
		, enter your e-mail address as password.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Port Number</code>
		<br> In order to connect to a remote service using TCP/IP, one
		must know the port number on which the service is running on the
		remote system. By default, the FTP service runs on port 21. However,
		this might not be the case all the time. For e.g. if you are
		connecting through a firewall or, if the FTP site administrator has
		set a different port for the FTP service. Contact your system
		administrator or the site's administrator if the default port does not
		work well for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Account</code>
		<br> Enter your account number or account name to log in. Most
		FTP sites do not need account information during log in. However, if
		your FTP site needs one, enter it here.
	</p>
	<p class="note">
		<img src="../images/note32.gif" border="0" width="32" height="32"
			align="bottom" alt="Note"> At this point, you may click on the
		<code>Add</code>
		button to add the FTP site to your favorites or, click on the
		<code>Security</code>
		tab to configure security options.
	</p>
	<h2>Security Tab</h2>
	<p>
		Click on the
		<code>Security</code>
		tab to configure security options for this FTP site.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Do Not Use SSL</code>
		<br> Select this radio button to use plain TCP/IP connection. All
		commands and data will be sent un-encrypted when this option is
		selected.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Use SSL If Available</code>
		<br> Select this radio button to tell JFTP to use a secured
		connection if the server you are connecting to supports SSL. If the
		server supports SSL, all commands and/or data that is transferred will
		be encrypted.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Use Explicit SSL</code>
		<br> Select this radio button to tell JFTP to use an Explicit SSL
		connection. This means, after connecting to the FTP server, JFTP will
		negotiate for an SSL connection and if it succeeds, the plain TCP/IP
		connection will be transformed into an SSL connection. If the SSL
		negotiation fails for any reason, the connection will be closed.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Use Implicit SSL</code>
		<br> Select this radio button to connect to the FTP server using
		an implicit SSL connection.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Port Number</code>
		<br> Enter the port number to connect to for an Implicit SSL
		connection. The default port number for Implicit SSL is 990. If your
		FTP server listens on a port other than the default, enter that port
		number here.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Do Not Encrypt Data Channel</code>
		<br> Select this option to instructs JFTP not to use SSL for
		transferring actual data such as file transfers and directory
		listings. With this option selected, only commands that are sent over
		the command channel are encrypted, such as your user name and
		password.
	</p>

			align="bottom" alt="Note"> At this point, you may click on the
		<code>Add</code>
		button to add the FTP site to your favorites or, click on the
		<code>Advanced</code>
		tab to configure advanced connect options.
	</p>
	<h2>Advanced Tab</h2>
	<p>
		The advanced connect options can be set by clicking on the
		<code>Advanced</code>
		tab in the
		<code>Add Favorite FTP Site</code>
		dialog.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>FTP Client</code>
		<br> Select the FTP client that you would like to use for
		connecting to this FTP site. This drop-down box contains the list of
		all installed FTP clients. You can see the list by clicking on the
		down arrow of the drop-down box. The default installation of JFTP
		comes with two different clients:
	<ul>
		<li><code>Default FTP Client</code></li>
		<li><code>AS/400 FTP Client</code></li>
	</ul>
	The
	<code>Default FTP Client</code>
	works well with most FTP servers. The AS/400 FTP client is specifically
	designed for connecting to AS/400 FTP servers.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>List Parser</code>
		<br> Select a list parser that you would like to use for this FTP
		site. This drop-down box contains the list of all installed list
		parsers. A list parser is a small program used to parse the directory
		listing produced by an FTP server in response to the
		<code>LIST</code>
		command. The default installation of JFTP comes with the following two
		list parsers:
	<ul>
		<li><code>Default List Parser (UNIX)</code></li>
		<li><code>MS-DOS List Parser</code></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The
		<code>Default List Parser</code>
		works well with most FTP servers that produce UNIX style directory
		listing. The MS-DOS list parser is used to pasre the DOS style
		directory listing.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Initial Local Directory</code>
		<br> Enter a valid directory that you would like to set as
		initial local working directory for this session. Upon connecting to
		the FTP site, the working directory in the local pane will be changed
		to the directory you specify here.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Browse...</code>
		<br> Use this button to open a file dialog that allows you to
		browse the local file system and select an existing directory to be
		used as
		<code>Initial Local Directory</code>
		.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Initial Remote Directory</code>
		<br> Enter a valid directory that you would like to set as
		initial remote working directory for this session. Upon connecting to
		the FTP site, the working directory in the remote pane will be changed
		to the directory you specify here.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Transfer Data in Passive Mode</code>
		<br> To transfer a file using FTP, a data connection needs to be
		established between your PC and the FTP site. The data connection can
		be opened in either active or passive modes. In the active mode, the
		FTP site establishes the data connection to your PC (client). In the
		passive mode, the PC establishes a connection to the FTP site. The
		passive mode is helpful if you are behind a firewall and your firewall
		does not accept incoming connections from computers outside of your
		network.
	</p>
	<p>Check this check box to transfer data in passive mode.
		Unchecking this will cause the data to be transferred in active mode.
	</p>
	<p class="note">

			align="bottom" alt="Note"> At this point, you may click on the
		<code>Add</code>
		button to add the FTP site to your favorites or, click on the
		<code>Commands</code>
		tab to further customize the connect options.
	</p>
	<h2>Commands Tab</h2>
	<p>This tab is provided for the sake of advanced users who are
		familiar with FTP protocol and site specific features.</p>
	<p>
		<code>Execute the following commands after login</code>
		<br> You may request JFTP to execute zero or more FTP commands up
		on successful login. A simple example would be, if you want to know
		what all features an FTP site supports, you issue the
		<code>HELP</code>
		command. However, in practical scenarios, you use this feature to
		alter some site specific parameters such as changing the directory
		listing style; i.e. whether to list the directory contents in server
		operating system's proprietary format or to list them in standard UNIX
		format. In this text area, enter the FTP commands that you would like
		to execute after login. Make sure to separate each command by a new
		line.
	</p>
	<h2>Command Buttons</h2>
	<p>
		<code>Add</code>
		<br> Clicking this button validates the input you have provided,
		closes the
		<code>Add Favorite FTP Site</code>
		dialog and adds the FTP site to your favorites list. The new site you
		have added will appear in the list in
		<code>Manage Favorites </code>
		dialog.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Cancel</code>
		<br> Clicking this button simply closes the
		<code>Add Favorite FTP Site</code>
		dialog.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>Help</code>
		<br> Click this button to display help.
