	<h1>Deleting Favorites</h1>
	<p>To delete one or more FTP sites from your favorites list, open
		the favorite manager by doing any one of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Select <code>Tools -&gt; Manage Favorites...</code> menu item
			from the menu bar
		</li>
		<li>Click on the <img src="../images/favorites16.gif" width="16"
			height="16">&nbsp;&nbsp;icon in the tool bar
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Doing any of the above actions will open the
		<code>Manage Favorites</code>
		dialog.
	</p>
	<p>
		The
		<code>Manage Favorites</code>
		dialog displays a list of all your favorite FTP sites in alphabetical
		order. From the list, select (or highlight) the FTP site(s) that you
		would like to delete and click on the
		<code>Delete</code>
		button. This will open a confirmation dialog asking you if you really
		want to delete the selected FTP sites from your favorites. Click on
		the
		<code>Yes</code>
		button to permanently delete the selected FTP sites from your
		favorites. Click on the
		<code>Cancel</code>
		button to cancel the delete operation.
