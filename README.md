JFTP - The Universal FTP Client
===============================

Introduction
------------

JFTP is a graphical FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client software for 
transferring files from one computer to another over TCP/IP networks such as 
Internet.

JFTP can connect to any system that has a valid Internet address and an FTP 
server program, allowing you to transfer files between a wide variety of 
systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, UNIX and IBM i(AS/400) systems.

JFTP integrates the most widely used and widely accepted security mechanism, 
SSL (Secured Sockets Layer), to securely transfer your business critical and 
sensitive data.

JFTP is written entirely in Java(tm), meaning, it can run on a wide variety of 
platforms such as Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, OS/2, UNIX or any 
other platform with a compatible JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
