JFTP - The Universal FTP Client
===============================

Introduction
------------

JFTP is a graphical FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client software for 
transferring files from one computer to another over TCP/IP networks such as 
Internet.

JFTP can connect to any system that has a valid Internet address and an FTP 
server program, allowing you to transfer files between a wide variety of 
systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, UNIX and IBM i(AS/400) systems.

JFTP integrates the most widely used and widely accepted security mechanism, 
SSL (Secured Sockets Layer), to securely transfer your business critical and 
sensitive data.

JFTP is written entirely in Java(tm), meaning, it can run on a wide variety of 
platforms such as Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, OS/2, UNIX or any 
other platform with a compatible JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

###File Filters

File filters give you the ability to decide what all files may be listed, 
uploaded, downloaded or deleted with in JFTP. You can set up either inclusion 
or exclusion filters on local and/or remote files based on a variety of 
criteria such as:

* File name pattern using regular expressions
* Modification date of the files
* Attributes of the files (if a file is hidden or not)

Using file filters, uploading all the files in your site that were modified on 
a specific date is as easy as a click of a mouse. No more need to spend time 
in picking up individual files in several directories of your web site.

* Download As option to download a single file or directory (and its contents) 
  as a different name
* Download and Unzip option to automatically unzip downloaded zip files

###Connect Quickly and Easily

Well thought-out design allows you to connect to your FTP site quickly and 
easily. You can configure both simple and advanced connection parameters, all 
through one easy-to-use connection dialog.

###Advanced Connection Options

JFTP allows you to specify various advanced connection parameters such as:

* Whether to use plain FTP connection or secured FTP connection
* Ability to provide an "Account" name for login. Most FTP servers just use 
  user name and password for login, but, some require account name to be 
  specified for login.
* Option of encrypting just the command channel to securely transmit the 
  password over the network
* Specify initial local and remote working directories to set, upon a 
  successful login
* Support for both passive (default) and active data transfers
* Allows you to execute raw FTP commands (standard or custom) soon after log in

certificates. Certificates are used to establish secured FTP connections. With 
JFTP's certificate manger, you can -

* View details of a certificate
* Delete certificates from your trusted certificates database

###Manage your Favorite FTP Sites

JFTP allows you to store the connection parameters for the FTP sites that you 
frequently work with. With JFTP, connecting to your favorite FTP site is just 
one click away! In addition, for added security, JFTP stores all your favorite 
site definitions in encrypted format.

###Auto-Detection of Transfer Type

manually setting the transfer type is impossible.
